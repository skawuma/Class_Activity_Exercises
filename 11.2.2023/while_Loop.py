# Python code to display Multiples of 5 bewtwen 50 and 25 

# A variable that would be used in the loop control statement
n = int(input("Enter the first number (temp): "))

# The loop would execute until the value of n is greater than 0
while n >= 25: 

	# Displaying the value of n for that iteration
	print(n) 
	
	# Decrementing the value by 5
	n = n - 5	
	
print("Loop Ends!")
